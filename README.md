# fraud-detection-model

Project Overview:
Fraud detection is a critical task in many industries, especially in finance and e-commerce. This project utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to build a fraud detection model, leveraging data preprocessing techniques and feature engineering to improve model performance.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project should be in CSV format and should contain both numerical and categorical features. The target variable should indicate whether a transaction is fraudulent.

Usage:
Place your dataset in the project directory and update the file path in the script.
Run the main script:

Data Preprocessing:

    Handling Missing Values:
      Missing values are filled with the median value of each column to ensure that no data is lost during the preprocessing step.

    Handling Categorical Data:
      Categorical columns are identified and converted to numerical values using one-hot encoding.

    Outlier Detection:
      Outliers are detected and removed using the z-score method to ensure that the model is not skewed by extreme values.

Model Building:
The Random Forest Classifier is used to build the fraud detection model.

Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.

Feature Importance
The importance of each feature is visualized to identify the key factors that predict fraudulent behavior.
